ORIGINAL INPUT: nn_train_data
1. A list
2. Each element in list is a two-element list
3. first element is a list of lists


GOAL: there are no specifics in nn.py to the type of data input from nn_train_data.py, eg dimensions or composition. All processing is done in the train file

Requirements for training set:
1. list of lists with two elements: input(s), then correct output(s)


STEPS
1. Identify where there is dataset-specific processing still in nn.py
2. Move processing to training set file
3. Check how J's nn.py takes input, and what kind
4. Make a training set with a different evaluation - 3 inputs (8 different sets possible), then count output sum, so 4 possible outputs
5. Run the new training set with existing network
